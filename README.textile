h1. ColdFusion powered Sencha Apps from SenchaCon 2011

These code examples are from my talk at SenchaCon 2011.  There are 7 examples.
* Standard Form - Demo – posting data to a cfm page
* AJAX form - Demo – posting to data to cfm page via AJAX
* DataGrid - Demo – use data model and store to populate datagrid
* CFQueryReader - Steve Cutter Blade’s client side query reader to parse Cfquery on the client
* DataGrid and Add Form - Demo – add new record and refresh datagrid
* DataGrid and Add/Edit Form - Demo – populate datagrid, select item and update record and refresh datagrid
* Sencha Touch List/Store/Model - Demo – list, add and update records


h2. Installation

You'll want to install the files in your webroot where ColdFusion 9 is running.  And you'll need to create
a datasource in the ColdFusion Administrator called "SenchaCon".

The ORM feature will create the tables and you can load example 4, add a few contacts and then play with examples 3 - 7.
